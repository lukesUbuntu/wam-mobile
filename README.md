Whats Around Me Android Application

Team: Luke, Maen, Yar, Michael M (Developers), Sid (Designer), Bruce (Lead Mentor)

What problem are we solving? What’s Around Me (WAM) aims to reduce the number of apps and websites you need to use to find out what is going on around you. It uses geo-location to ensure that you are not bombarded with information that is not relevant to you.

## Tech Stack:

The following technologies were used to create WAM:
-   PHP (Phalcon Framework)
-   jQuery
-   Ionic framework
-   Apache Cordova
-   Angular JS
-   Bootstrap
-   HTML and CSS

## API List

-   NZTA (New Zealand Transport Agency)
-   Wellynews
-   Google API
-   Eventfinda
-   Wunderground (Metservice data through an American API)
-   
The web application is hosted in a Linux environment on an apache server, this server handled all API calls and was also used to cache the data retrieved by the API’s to provide the user with a faster experience as well as give our API providers a bit of a break.

The Android application was developed using Apache Cordova, AngularJS and the ionic framework.
